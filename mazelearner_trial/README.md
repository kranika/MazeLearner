# Maze Learner 

- A retro version of MazeRunner that utilises Python 3D modelling to expose a 'Word of the Day Challenge' in a maze. The player navigates within the maze, with the help of letters which will adapt a certain color, as the guide towards the end goal.
- This specific folder represents the sample of how the maze appears, with letters made into blocks.
